# AI-assisted-generative-p5

This is the code base of the generative p5 project by Jiaqi Wu and Eytan Adar.

### Goal:
We explore how to amplify this process by connecting real-world inspirations, vague intents, and abstract patterns. 

Specifically, 

how can generative AI augment generative procedural arts cooperating with traditional randomness
function? 

How can computational methods help translate intentions and inspirations in various forms to mathematical rules in forms of code? 

We have developed a p5.js library supporting various functions for creating generative procedural arts by sourcing images using color and geometric information, and building a novel interface where artists can make full use of both the
programmability of code and stylization ability of real time generative AI.

### Methods
We are still developing and keep releasing the code! You can try these examples we updated:
