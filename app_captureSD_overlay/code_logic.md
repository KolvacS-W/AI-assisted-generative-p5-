This `app.js` script is part of a web application that interacts with a p5.js sketch and a WebSocket server. It captures, processes, and manages screenshots from a p5.js canvas. Here's how it works:

### At Page Load:

1. **WebSocket Connection**: Upon loading, the script establishes a WebSocket connection to a server (located at 'ws://localhost:3003'). It sets up handlers for open, close, and error events of this connection.

2. **User Interface Setup**: The script creates UI elements (strength slider, prompt input, update button, stop and continue buttons) and appends them to their respective containers (`controls-container` and `switch-container`). Event listeners are attached to these buttons and input elements.

3. **Initialization**: The script clears images on the server by making a fetch request to 'http://localhost:3003/clear-images'. It also resets various counters and flags, and clears any existing content in the screenshot and processed containers.

### After "Execute p5.js Code" Button Clicked:

1. **Code Execution**: When the "Execute p5.js Code" button is clicked, the script reads the p5.js code from the textarea (`p5-code`), creates an iframe containing this code, and starts the p5.js sketch within this iframe.

2. **Capturing Screenshots**: The p5.js sketch is set up to capture a screenshot every 500 milliseconds. These screenshots are sent to the parent window (where `app.js` is running) using `postMessage`.

3. **Processing Screenshots**: When a message (screenshot) is received, and if capturing is enabled (`isCapturing` is true), the script:
    - Increments the screenshot counter.
    - Compresses the received image.
    - Updates the image and its counter on the UI.
    - Sends the image URL to the WebSocket server.

4. **WebSocket Message Handling**: When a message is received from the WebSocket server (`onmessage` event), the script processes the incoming data (processed images) and displays them if processing is enabled (`isProcessing` is true). It also handles saving these processed images.

### "Stop" and "Continue" Button Functionality:

- **Stop Button**: When clicked, sets the `isCapturing` and `isProcessing` flags to `false`, effectively stopping the capture of new screenshots and processing of incoming images from the server.

- **Continue Button**: When clicked, sets the `isCapturing` and `isProcessing` flags to `true`, resuming the capture and processing of images.

### Additional Notes:

- The script includes a commented-out section for viewing saved images, which suggests additional functionality might be planned or previously existed.
- The script handles image compression and resizing, and it sends processed image details to the server.
- The WebSocket connection is used to send image URLs to the server and receive processed image results.
- The script is designed to work in conjunction with a specific server setup and a p5.js sketch.

Overall, the script integrates p5.js sketches with a server via WebSockets, handling UI controls, image processing, and real-time data exchange to create an interactive and dynamic web application.
